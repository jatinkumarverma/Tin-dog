# TinDog App Landing Page
This is a responsive landing page for a fictional dating app called TinDog. The app is designed to connect dog owners and their furry friends with other dog owners for playdates, walks, and possibly even love connections.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features a clean and modern design, complete with a responsive navigation menu, call-to-action buttons, and a carousel to display the app's features.
